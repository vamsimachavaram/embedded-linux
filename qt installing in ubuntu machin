Install Qt 5 on Ubuntu
Introduction

This is a tutorial for installation of Qt 5.7.0 to Ubuntu 12.10. It may be used for some newer versions of Qt and Ubuntu. As a counterexample, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS uses an independent system for controlling the Qt version. Following these directions for Ubuntu 16.04 results in an error where a file can't be found in a qt4 directory, even though you're installing qt5 not 4. Another difference for OpenGL has been found and added as a note below.
Installation Guide

    Download

Visit Qt downloads page an download a 32-bit or 64-bit Linux installation depending your version of Ubuntu. The installation file can be also downloaded through the command line using wget.

Example:

wget http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.7/5.7.0/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.7.0.run

    Install

Adjust permission, run the installer and follow the instruction to complete the installation.

chmod +x qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.7.0.run
./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.7.0.run

    Install g++

Open a terminal and execute the following command to install g++:

sudo apt-get install build-essential

    Install generic font configuration library - runtime

Open a terminal and execute the following command to install the full runtime files for the generic font configuration library:

sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1

    Configure a compiler

Launch Qt Creator. Go to Tools > Options. Click Build & Run and select tab Kit. Configure a compiler if it is not automatically detected.

    Install OpenGL libraries

Execute the following command to install OpenGL libraries:

sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev

Note: Just installing the above-mentioned mesa-common-dev kit is not sufficient for more recent Ubuntu versions. Based on a comment in the Qt forum[1] an additional package needs installation. Execute following command:

sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev -y

Tested with Qt5.3.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 and it solved the problem with missing -lGL.

    Set file association with pro files

When installing from the on-line source the file association is not done automatically. It also not show up when you try to associate it with file explorer. Create a file named “Qt-Creator.desktop” and fill the file with the following.

[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Type=Application
Name=QtCreator
Comment=QtCreator
NoDsiplay=true
Exec=(Install folder of QT)/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator %f
Icon=(Install folder of QT)/5.4/Src/qtdoc/doc/images/landing/icon_QtCreator_78x78px.png
Name[en_US]=Qt-Creator

Place this file in home .local/share/applications .

Edit a file named “defaults.list” in the same directory . Add the following line.

text/qtcreator=Qt-Creator.desktop;

open file mimeapps.list and check if the following line is present.

application/vnd.nokia.qt.qmakeprofile=qtcreator.desktop

if not add it under [added Associations].

Run the following command.

sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime

now Qt has been added to the list of file associations.
Troubleshooting

    Qt Creator needs a compiler set up to build

Follow the instruction from the previous section to configure compiler for Qt Creator.

    error: g++: Command not found

Solution:

sudo apt-get install build-essential

    error: GL/gl.h: No such file or directory
