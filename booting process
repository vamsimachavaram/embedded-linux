The heart of a modern computer is one or more Central Processing Units.

A CPU gets its instructions from memory.
The CPU reads instruction from the BIOS and searches for the hard disks, CD drives and other hardware.
The BIOS program looks at the first sector for boot code.
Devices that feed the initial CPU instructions are known as bootstrap media.

The Booting is a process involving 2 stages:
  getting hardware up and running, and
  getting the OS and other software up and running
  
Power up; computer runs POST----->POST mean 

power-on self-test -- one of the first processes that a computer undergoes when booting
POST tests the computer to ensure that it is working as it is supposed to.
POST can detect some errors with the processor, motherboard, RAM and other memory, as well as the video card.
Most BIOS chips use a system of beep codes to indicate the POST status to the user and each BIOS chipset uses a different code.


Boot sequence governed by BIOS ROM
BIOS parameters stored in CMOS
BIOS ROM may be password protected
Control passes to the MBR of the first bootable device detected
MBR points to boot record of selected operating system
Operating system takes control

6. Plug and play BIOS
create an ISR for detect HArdware card .
The boot code in a DOS disk exists in the first 446 bytes of the first 512 byte sector, which is the MBR.
The end of the sector contains the partition table.
Boot sector viruses insert themselves into the first 446 bytes of the MBR so that they are executed every time the computer is booted.
